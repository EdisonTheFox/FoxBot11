## Why Build a bot, there are loads

Firstly I want to consolidate all the bots and services I use. This currently includes StreamLabs, MEE6, Rhythm (This was a planned addition to my server) and NightBot (rarely use this but I do on occasion).
By consolidating everything and writing it myself I can manage the code and admin without clunky interfaces and remembering the multitude of sites that help manage the aforementioned bots.
